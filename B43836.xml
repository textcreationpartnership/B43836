            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>He happen'd to meet <hi>Little John,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>a jolly brisk Blade, right fit for the trade,</l>
               <l>For he was a lusty young Man.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Though he was call'd <hi>Little,</hi> his limbs they were large,</l>

                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>And his stature was seven foot high;</l>
               <l>where-ever he come, they quak'd at his name,</l>
               <l>For soon he wou'd make them to flie.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>How they came acquainted, I'll tell you in brief,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>If you will but listen a while;</l>
               <l>for this very jest, amongst all the rest,</l>
               <l>I think it may cause you to smile:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Bold <hi>Robin Hood</hi> said to his jolly Bowmen,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>Pray tarry you here in this grove.</l>
               <l>and see that you all, observe well my call,</l>
               <l>While thorough the fortest I rove.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>We have had no sport for their fourteen long days,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>Therefore now abroad will I go;</l>
               <l>now should I be beat, and cannot retreat,</l>
               <l>My horn I will presently blow.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then did he shake hands with his merry Men all,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>And bid them at present good-by;</l>
               <l>then as near a brook his journey he took,</l>
               <l>A Stranger he chanc'd to espy:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They happen'd to meet on a long narrow bridge,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>And neither of them wou'd give way;</l>
               <l>quoth bold <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> and sturdily stood,</l>
               <l>I'll show you right <hi>Nottingham</hi> play;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With that from his quiver an arrow he drew,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>A broad arrow with a goose-wing:</l>
               <l>the Stranger reply'd, I'll licker thy hide,</l>
               <l>If thou offer to touch the string.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Quoth bold <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> Thou do'st prate like an Ass,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>For were I to bend but my bow,</l>
               <l>I could send a dart quite through thy proud heart,</l>
               <l>Before thou could'st strike me one blow.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>You talk like a Coward, the Stranger reply'd,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>Well arm'd with a long bow you stand,</l>
               <l>to shoot at my breast, while I, I protest,</l>
               <l>Have naught but a staff in my hand.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The name of a Coward, quoth <hi>Robin,</hi> I scorn,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>Wherefore my long bow I'll lay by,</l>
               <l>and now for thy sake a staff I will take,</l>
               <l>The truth of thy Manhood to try.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then <hi>Robin Hood</hi> stept to a thicket of trees,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>And chose him a staff of ground oak;</l>
               <l>now this being done, away he did run</l>
               <l>To the Stranger, and merrily spoke:</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And first <hi>Robin</hi> he gave the Stranger a bang.</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O then into a fury the Stranger he grew,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>And gave him a damnable look;</l>
               <l>and with it a blow, that laid him full low,</l>
               <l>And tumbl'd him into the brook.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I prithee, good Fellow, O where art thou now?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>The Stranger in laugher he cry'd:</l>
               <l>quoth bold <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> Good faith in the flood,</l>
               <l>And floting along with the tide.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I needs must acknowledge thou art a brave Soul.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>With thee I'll no longer contend;</l>
               <l>for needs must I say, thou hast got the day,</l>
               <l>Our battle shall be at an end.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then, then to the bank he did presently wade,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>And pull'd himself out by a thorn;</l>
               <l>which done, at the last, he blowd a loud blast</l>
               <l>Straitways on his fine bugle-horn:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The eccho of which through the vallies did flie,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>At which his stout Bowmen appear'd.</l>
               <l>all cloathed in green, most gay to be seen,</l>
               <l>So up to their Master they steer'd:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O what's the matter? quoth <hi>William Stuteley;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>Good Master, you are wet to the skin?</l>
               <l>No matter, quoth he, the Lad which you see,</l>
               <l>In fighting he tumbl'd me in.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He shall not go scot free the others reply'd,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>So straight they were seising him there,</l>
               <l>to duck him likewise; but <hi>Robin Hood</hi> cries,</l>
               <l>He is a stout Fellow, forbear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>There's no one shall wrong thee, Friend, be not afraid,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>These Bowmen upon me do wait;</l>
               <l>there's threescore and nine; if thou wilt be mine,</l>
               <l>Thou shalt have my livery strait,</l>

               <l>Speak up, jolly Blade, ne'r fear,</l>
               <l>I'll reach thee also the use of the bow,</l>
               <l>To shoot at the far fallow-deer.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O here is my hand, the Stranger reply'd,</l>

               <l>they lov'd what was good: so in the green wood</l>
               <l>This pritty sweet Babe they baptize.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>This Infant was called <hi>John Little,</hi> quoth he,</l>
